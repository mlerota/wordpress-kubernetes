# WordPress development with Bedrock for Kubernetes

[Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) is a modern WordPress stack that helps you get started with the best development tools and project structure.

Much of the philosophy behind Bedrock is inspired by the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) methodology including the [WordPress specific version](https://roots.io/twelve-factor-wordpress/).

## Features

* Better folder structure
* Dependency management with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
* Easy WordPress configuration with environment specific files
* Environment variables with [Dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)
* Autoloader for mu-plugins (use regular plugins as mu-plugins)
* Enhanced security (separated web root and secure passwords with [wp-password-bcrypt](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt))

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6
* Composer - [Install](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)

## Installation

1. Create a new project in a new folder for your project:
